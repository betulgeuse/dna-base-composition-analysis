# DNA Base Composition Analysis

This basic project calculates and visualizes the frequency and percentage of each nucleotide (A, T, G, C) in a DNA sequence.

## Project Goal
To demonstrate the use of basic data science tools (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib) in a biological context.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **NumPy** – for array-based calculations  
- **Pandas** – for tabular data representation  
- **Matplotlib** – for visualization  

---

## How It Works
1. A DNA sequence is given as a string.  
2. The script counts how many times A, T, G, and C appear.  
3. Percentages are calculated using NumPy.  
4. Results are displayed in a Pandas DataFrame.  
5. The base composition is visualized using a bar chart.
